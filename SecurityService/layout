client first requests access from the authentication server.
    creating a log in request msg, encrypiting it with the key derieved from the password provided by the user. P1
    pass this w/ the user id to AS
    Using stored user password (P1) to decrypt the msg and verifies content to establish Authentication
    Maybe user name password tuples can be stored on the AS


AS responds w/ token
    Token: ticket, a session key, ID of the server for who the ticket is for, timeout period
        Ticket: session key
    session key is a key generated at random - encrypts and dycrypts comm between client and server
    ticket is encrypted with a server encryption key which is only known by the AS and the target server
    Token is encrypted with key from client password P1

Client to send msg to server
    use session key to encrypt all msg's
    also sends ticket (without encrypting it) --- ticket + encrypted message

server rec req
    dycripts ticket to obtain session key
        then decrypts the msg with the session key
        performs reqyest
        generates response & encrypts the response with the session key

Client dycripts response with session key
