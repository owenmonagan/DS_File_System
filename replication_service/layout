Master slave model:
all replication servers are aware of other servers

Primiary copy acts as sync
    All writes go to primary copy
    reads can also go to primary copy

slaves
    provide read service


Election Algrorithm,
    bully
    largest id becomes the primary copy
    at failure to connect to primary copy
    the server sends a election message to each replication server
        if a server has a higher ID it replies with an election message
        then sends another election message

        else if no server replies then server becomes the primary copy
            and then sends out an elected message



primary copy
    accepts all requests
        if read forward
        else write and forward update


replication server
    accepts uploads from primary copy
    on read request queries
